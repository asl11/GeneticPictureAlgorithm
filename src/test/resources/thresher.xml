                Rice bandmembers thought they were just making fun of Deflategate, but their prank

                Rice president David Leebron congratulated the servery on its culinary
                accomplishments. Said one student, "Sure, it's an impressive win, and I never knew
                ramen could be so good, but it seems a bit much when they put gold leaf in
                everything."
