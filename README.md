# GeneticPictureAlgorithm

This java program uses a genetic algorithm to generate pictures, and then supports the option to breed two pictures together for further generations. This Project was done with Joshua Dong.

Each picture is represented by a mathematical function composed of json objects, where each pixel's rgb value is the output of the x and y coordinates into the picture's mathematical function. Breeding is done by taking mathematical functions and randomly taking parts out, or through swapping function trees.

The main file is prettypictures.java
