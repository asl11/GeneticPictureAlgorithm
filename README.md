## Week 14/15: Pretty Pictures (Week 3)

This three-week long project will take place in 
[src/main/java/edu/rice/prettypictures](/../../tree/master/src/main/java/edu/rice/prettypictures).

## Student Information
Please edit _README.md_ and replace your instructor's name and NetID with your own:
(In future weeks, we'll have more things for you to do here.)

_Student 1 name_: Joshua Dong

_Student 1 NetID_: jd54

_Student 2 name_: Alex Li

_Student 2 NetID_: asl11

Your NetID is typically your initials and a numeric digit. That's
what we need here.

_If you contacted us in advance about the late policy and we approved a late submission,
please cut-and-paste the text from that email here._

## Part3 ToDo Items

To make your graders lives easier, please answer these questions:

1) Did you implement TEST 3 (mutants)? ( yes / no )
2) Did you implement TEST 4 (crossbreeding)? ( yes / no )
3) Where did you put your "ten favorite images" and their JSON genotypes? ( directory/name/here )
4) Where is the unit test that exercises your GeneTree lenses? ( directory/name/here )
5) Where is the unit test that exercises your GeneTree mutation? ( directory/name/here )
6) Where is the unit test that exercises your GeneTree crossbreeding? ( directory/name/here )
7) Where are the unit tests that exercises your multi-generation database JSON loading and saving? ( directory/name/here )
8) Where are the unit tests that exercises your multi-generation database's ability to fetch individual genes and create new generations? ( directory / name / here )

## Q&A

Please answer these questions with one or two short sentences each. Note that each partner will
answer these separately.

### Student 1

**GeneTree / RandomGeneTree**
- What were some similarities in how you defined your GeneTree last week and how our reference implementation works?

  (Your answer.)
  
- What were some significant differences in how you defined your GeneTree last week?

  (Your answer.)
  
**Crossbreeding**
- Last week, we asked you to think about how you would *crossbreed* two parent gene-trees together, getting a
  new child gene-tree. How does your idea from last week compare to our lens-based approach this week?

  (Your answer.)

### Student 2
